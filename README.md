EFI folder for booting up hackintosh Sonoma 14.2 as well as Ventura 13.6.6 on razerBlade 15 Adv Late 2019 bios 1.05
Note: Sonoma requires Secure Vault to be set to Disabled during installation under quirks. It has to be set to default after macOS boots up. Need to update airportitlwn for Sonoma 14.4.0+ as apple changed airport functionality.
